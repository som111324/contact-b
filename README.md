# Contact Management System

This is a Contact Management System that allows users to manage customer/client details. The system includes the ability to create, view, update, and delete contact information, making it an ideal solution for maintaining organized and up-to-date records.

---

## Features

- **Add New Contacts:** Input essential details like First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Company, and Job Title.
- **View Contacts:** Browse through a list of contacts displayed in a table format with sorting and pagination features.
- **Edit Contacts:** Update existing contact details to ensure information is current.
- **Delete Contacts:** Remove outdated or duplicate contacts for better data management.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI (MUI)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (locally or via MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning repositories)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/som111324/contact_manage frontend
git clone https://github.com/som111324/contact-b backend
```

This will create two folders:
- `frontend` for the React app.
- `backend` for the Node.js API.

---

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-connection-string` with your MongoDB connection URI.

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add a proxy for the backend in the `package.json` file:
   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 4. Running the Application

1. Ensure both servers are running:
   - **Backend** at `http://localhost:5000`
   - **Frontend** at `http://localhost:3000`

2. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Database Schema

### Contacts Collection
Each contact is stored with the following structure:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
  "company": "Example Inc.",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer"
}
```

---

## Challenges Faced

- **Understanding React Functions:** Managing state and integrating form inputs with React hooks took some time to grasp.
- **Proxy Setup:** Configuring the frontend to communicate with the backend required resolving CORS-related issues.
- **Pagination and Sorting:** Implementing these features with Material-UI's Table component required a thoughtful approach.
- **Validation:** Ensuring the backend and frontend validation aligned for smooth data handling.

---

## Future Improvements

- Adding user authentication for secure access.
- Implementing a bulk import/export feature for contacts.
- Enhancing UI responsiveness for smaller devices.
